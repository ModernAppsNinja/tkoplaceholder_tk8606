VMware container networking with Antrea is an integrated Kubernetes service for managing Windows and Linux workloads across multiple clouds.  

Antrea is a Kubernetes-native project that implements the Container Network Interface (CNI) and Kubernetes NetworkPolicy thereby providing network connectivity and security for pod workloads. Antrea extends the benefit of programmable networks from Open vSwitch (OVS) to Kubernetes.  

Antrea is the default networking used for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.
