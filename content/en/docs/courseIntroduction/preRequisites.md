We recommend taking the [Introduction to VMware Tanzu
Portfolio](https://lms.modernapps.ninja/courses/course-v1:modernapps+COU-TP6539+Perpetual/course/) course
prior to taking this course.

This course assumes familiarity witha the basic components which make up Tanzu Kubernetes Operations:
- Tanzu Kubernetes Grid
- Tanzu Mission Control
- Tanzu Observability
- Tanzu Service Mesh
- Avi/NSX Load Balancer

If you do not have a conversational level of knowledge about these technologies you may benefit from reviewing the following:

For Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid) and the Hands On Lab #2234  
For Tanzu Mission Control (https://tanzu.vmware.com/mission-control) and the Hands On Lab #2234  
For Tanzu Observability 
For Tanzu Service Mesh
For Avi: (https://avinetworks.com/education/)

You may also want to familarize yourself with the Tanzu portfolio and  TKO labs on Pathfinder:

Tanzu Standard [https://pathfinder.vmware.com/path/tanzu_standard] (https://pathfinder.vmware.com/path/tanzu_standard)   
TKO (https://pathfinder.vmware.com/v3/path/tko_path)  
AVI/NSX Load Balancer (https://pathfinder.vmware.com/v3/path/nsxbc)  


Additonally some  familarity with  Kubernetes and Cloud Native
Technologies. If you are not familiar with these technologies, we
recommend checking out [KubeAcademy](https://kube.academy/) by VMware,
which has a terrific set of free, bite-size video resources on the
basics of containers, Kubernetes and cloud native that are great for
beginners.

Before taking this course, you should also have familiarity with vSphere
administration. If you need additional background in vSphere, we
recommend checking out [VMware Hands on Labs](https://hol.vmware.com),
which offers a number of vSphere labs and content including labs which cover TKO and the components which comprise the bundle.
