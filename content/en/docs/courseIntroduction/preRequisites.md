We recommend some  familarity with  Kubernetes and Cloud Native
Technologies. If you are not familiar with these technologies, we
recommend checking out [KubeAcademy](https://kube.academy/) by VMware,
which has a terrific set of free, bite-size video resources on the
basics of containers, Kubernetes and cloud native that are great for
beginners.

If you would like some  additional background on Tanzu and would like to use a live environment we
recommend checking out the many Tanzu Hands On Labs [VMware Hands on Labs](https://hol.vmware.com),
which offer a number of Tanzu labs  with the components which comprise TKO.

There are also excellent trainings available in VMware Pathfinder [Pathfinder](https://pathfinder.vmware.com/v3/path/tko_path)
