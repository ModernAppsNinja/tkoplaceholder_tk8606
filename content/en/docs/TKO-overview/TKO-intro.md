**What is Tanzu for Kubernetes Operations, or “TKO”**

Tanzu for Kubernetes Operations is a new marketing bundle (not a SKU!) that includes a set of products and services specifically targeted to meet the needs of on-prem and cloud infrastructure teams.   

TKO addresses:
Developer self-service to the right infrastructure abstraction and app building blocks
Automation and monitoring of cloud platform operations
Enforcement of Networking, security and compliance requirements
Platform operation cost optimization

TKO Includes:  
Tanzu Standard Runtime (TKG)  
Tanzu Mission Control (TMC)  
Tanzu Observability (TO)  
Tanzu Service Mesh Advanced (TSM)  
Antrea   
Avi Enterprise  


**What do you mean by “solution”? Is this like a new Tanzu Edition**   

No, this is not a new Tanzu edition, and it is not a new SKU. Right now, it is simply a set of existing product SKUs and services that deliver a key set of capabilities that we believe cloud infrastructure teams need in order to achieve their business outcomes.


**Is VMware still selling Tanzu editions?**

Yes, we are still selling Tanzu Basic, Tanzu Standard, and Tanzu Advanced. The TKO bundle is designed to enhance the existing Tanzu editions.
