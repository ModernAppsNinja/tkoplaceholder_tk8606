**What is Tanzu for Kubernetes Operations, or “TKO”**

Tanzu for Kubernetes Operations is a new marketing bundle (not a SKU!) that includes a set of products and services specifically targeted to meet the needs of on-prem and cloud infrastructure teams. We will start positioning this solution to cloud platform and infrastructure teams in October, after the sales team is enabled on 10/13.   

**What do you mean by “solution”? Is this like a new Tanzu Edition**   

No, this is not a new Tanzu edition, and it is not a new SKU. Right now, it is simply a set of existing product SKUs and services that deliver a key set of capabilities that we believe cloud infrastructure teams need in order to achieve their business outcomes—see the chart below for what is included.

**Wait, I’m confused—are we still selling Tanzu editions?**

Yes, we are still selling Tanzu Basic, Tanzu Standard, and Tanzu Advanced. However, we haven’t done a great job targeting these editions to specific buyers and their needs. For example, in H1, we found that sellers were commonly positioning and selling “Tanzu Standard++” deals—selling both Tanzu Standard and TMC Advanced, or Tanzu Standard and Tanzu Observability. Tanzu Standard wasn’t deemed to be robust enough for cloud infrastructure teams looking to stand up a production-grade k8s platform. 
But Tanzu Advanced, by contrast, includes nearly all of the GA Tanzu products. Trying to position it to cloud infrastructure teams who are just getting started with Kubernetes is a hard sell, requiring selling into multiple buying centers (app dev, infra, networking) and convincing the customer that they need to purchase and install everything up front, even if they aren’t ready to adopt it yet. 
In H2, sellers will position the right solution for the customer—whether that's Tanzu for K8s Operations, Tanzu Advanced, or a custom set of products and services—based on a series of qualifying questions to figure out what outcomes the customer really needs to achieve, and what capabilities they need to be able to unlock. We believe this will lead to more satisfied customers, less risk for shelfware, and a more competitive position in the market.
